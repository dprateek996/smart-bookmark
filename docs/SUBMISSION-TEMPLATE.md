## Short Summary

Built a Smart Bookmark App using Next.js App Router + Supabase with Google OAuth-only authentication, private per-user bookmarks via RLS, realtime updates across tabs, and delete support.  
The backend uses a consistent API response contract, Zod validation, and route-level error handling.  
I documented setup/deploy flow, added reproducible schema/policy SQL, and included focused unit tests for schema validation and response formatting.  
README also includes problems faced and solutions.
